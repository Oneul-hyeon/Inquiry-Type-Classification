# Inquiry-Type-Classification
## Installation

This project was created using Colab.

This project also clones the Modefied-KoBERT and Inquiry-Type-Classification repositories together.

That part exists at the top of each jupyter file.

## KoBERT Model

As COLAB was updated, there were environmental problems in cloning and using SKTBrain's KoBERT.

So I opened a repository called Modified-KoBERT and uploaded the modified requirements.txt.

In this project, I uploaded requirements.txt, which installed additional packages along with the packages used for Modified-KoBERT, to the repository.

Therefore, as explained in Installation, I induced the necessary packages to be installed through the code block at the top of each Jupyter file.

## Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/12NZhjvViVnYN7BLB-k9ZIgw7JjTVF6X8/view?usp=sharing.

This file should be stored in the root folder.

## Korean Stopword

It was downloaded from https://gist.github.com/chulgil/d10b18575a73778da4bc83853385465c#file-stopwords-txt.

You can more conveniently download the file from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SjwI8dnRkMHYp18znuizC_-CHvYWADDw/view?usp=sharing.

This file, like the dataset, should be stored in the root folder.

## Model

The trained model was uploaded to https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xEshJXtJiIo2su8c4wACn2K5Xh8cEFDo/view?usp=sharing using the '.pth' file extension.
